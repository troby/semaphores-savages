Savages are worker threads that try to fill their bowl from the pot.
When a savage gets their turn they use Turn.Lock() and check the
pot to see if it's empty. If it is, a signal is sent to cook to fill
the pot, and a signal is awaited in return. The cook fills the pot
and signals the savage to continue. The savage will fill his bowl
and invoke Turn.Unlock(). A savage thread eats and then exits.

When the savage threads exit a stop signal is sent to cook.
Cook will then terminate cleanly.
